;; Subject Glossary for SVO Demo
;;
;; Subjects represent the actors in your test scenarios.
;; Each subject is a keyword with a description.
;;
;; Subjects are normalized from step text:
;;   "Alice" -> :alice
;;   "System Admin" -> :system-admin
;;
;; Using a glossary helps:
;; - Catch typos ("Alcie" vs "Alice")
;; - Enforce consistent naming across features
;; - Document who/what each subject represents
